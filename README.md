# 💫 About Me:
👋 About Me<br>Hi there! I’m an aspiring software engineer from Angola and a proud student of 42. My programming journey began in February 2024 with the Piscine, and in May I officially became a cadet. Since then, I’ve been diving deep into the 42 common core curriculum, a path that constantly challenges me to think critically, solve problems, and write clean, efficient code.<br><br>🌟 Quick Facts<br>🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and advanced programming concepts through the 42 common core<br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source and student-driven projects in c/c++<br>🤝 I’m looking for help with improving my software design practices
